# Weather-Prediction-Using-AI-ML

This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to predict weather conditions based on historical data. We integrate an API from OpenWeather to fetch real-time data and train a model using historical weather data stored in a CSV file. The trained model provides insights on temperature, humidity, cloud description, pressure, and wind speed. A user-friendly webpage is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the weather forecast interactively.

🔹 Tech Stack: Python, Machine Learning, OpenWeather API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🔹 Features: Real-time weather updates, historical data-based predictions, and an intuitive web interface.

This repository contains the complete code for API integration, model training, and web development.
